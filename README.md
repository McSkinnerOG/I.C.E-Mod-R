<h1 align="center">👋 I.C.E-Mod For Immune Servers 👋</h1>

> Server modification to expand Immune's Server Software.<br /> `I.C.E` will supply you with new server based `admin` and `user` utilities.


## 🚀 Usage

Make sure you have a fresh [Immune-Dedicated-Server](https://store.steampowered.com/app/348670/Immune__True_Survival/) setup (The `IDS` is unfortunately shipped by default with the game from steam so there is no legitimate way to run a server without owning the game.)
